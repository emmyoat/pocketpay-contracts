# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains the **Stellar PocketPay – Savings Vault Contract**. The contract is written in **Rust** and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) to run on the **Soroban** blockchain platform. The architecture focuses on clear separation of concerns, deterministic on‑chain state management, and future extensibility for SDK integration.

The `contracts/savings_vault` directory houses the on‑chain logic. All other files are tooling, documentation, and repository metadata.

## State Management & Storage

The contract uses **Soroban SDK storage primitives**:

- **Persistent storage** (`storage::set`, `storage::get`) for user balances. Data stored here survives ledger expiry and is the source of truth for the vault.
- **Instance storage** for the admin address and initialization flag. This is scoped to the contract instance and cleared when the contract is removed.

The state model is deliberately simple:

| Key                | Type   | Description |
|--------------------|--------|-------------|
| `balance:{user}`   | `i128` | Unlocked funds available to a user.
| `locks:{user}`     | `Vec<LockEntry>` | List of active and matured lock entries for a user.
| `next_lock_id:{user}` | `u64`| Monotonically increasing next lock ID for a user.
| `admin`            | `Address` | Contract admin (set during `initialize`).
| `initialized`      | `bool`   | Guard to ensure `initialize` runs only once.

All operations validate inputs (non‑negative amounts, sufficient balances, future unlock times) and emit descriptive `require_auth` checks.

## Internal Balance Tracking and Asset Custody

The current deposit flow performs **internal accounting only**. Calling `deposit` updates the user's balance in contract storage; it does not transfer real XLM, a Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) asset, or any other token into contract custody.

Internal balance tracking records values that the contract uses for its deposit, withdrawal, and locking rules. Real token custody is different: it requires an on-chain asset transfer between addresses so that recorded balances are backed by assets actually held for users. Because that transfer layer is not implemented, the current stored balances must not be interpreted as proof of deposited or custodied assets.

Future SAC integration is planned to provide real asset transfer support and enable custody-backed balances.

---

## Secure Storage

On‑chain storage is inherently **secure**: data is stored in the ledger and can only be modified by authorized contract calls. The contract enforces authentication using `require_auth(env, caller)` for any state‑changing function, ensuring that only the address owning the funds can deposit, withdraw, or lock them.

---

## Stellar SDK Integration

The contract depends on the **Soroban SDK** (part of the Stellar ecosystem) for:

- **Environment handling** (`Env`) – provides access to ledger data and transaction context.
- **Address and authentication** – `Address` type and `require_auth` enforce permissions.
- **Storage APIs** – `storage::set`, `storage::get`, and `storage::has` for deterministic on‑chain state.
- **Testing utilities** – `testutils` to simulate ledger operations in unit tests.

Future enhancements may integrate the **Stellar Asset Contract (SAC)** to enable real token transfers, moving beyond internal balance bookkeeping.

---

## Future SDK Boundary

The current contract is a **stand‑alone savings vault**. To evolve into a full‑featured wallet SDK, consider the following extension points:

1. **Token Transfer Layer** – Call the SAC `transfer` function to move XLM or custom assets on‑chain.
2. **Admin Recovery & Upgrade** – Implement admin‑controlled migration or upgrade mechanisms using Soroban `upgrade` primitives.
3. **Off‑chain SDKs** – Provide JavaScript/TypeScript client libraries that abstract contract calls, handling address resolution, transaction building, and signing.

These boundaries maintain a clean separation between **on‑chain logic** (this repository) and **off‑chain SDKs** that developers will consume.

## Navigation (Documentation)

- The **README.md** provides quick‑start guides for building, testing, and deploying the contract.
- This **architecture.md** offers a deeper dive into internal design.
- [**sdk-contract-sequence.md**](sdk-contract-sequence.md) shows the end‑to‑end request flow (mobile → SDK → Soroban RPC → vault contract) for balance queries, deposits, withdrawals, and error paths.
- Additional module‑level docs (e.g., `admin-role.md`) cover specific responsibilities.

Refer to the **Documentation** section of the README for links to all docs.

## Contributing

When contributing, keep the following in mind:

- Follow the existing storage conventions.
- Write unit tests for any new state transitions.
- Update this architecture document if you add new modules or change the state model.
