# Stellar PocketPay — Savings Vault Contract

[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Project Status and Scope

This project is currently intended for development, learning, and Stellar testnet usage. It is **not production-ready or mainnet-ready**.

The savings vault now uses internal balance tracking and real token transfers: `deposit` transfers tokens from the user to the contract, `withdraw` transfers tokens from the contract to the user, and locking operations manage which tokens are available to withdraw.

See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) for other current constraints.
## Security Considerations

> **This contract is for educational and testnet use.** Review the following before any mainnet deployment.

See the [Admin Role](docs/admin-role.md) document for details on what the `initialize(admin)` value records, what the admin can and cannot do today, and future admin design considerations.
See the [Emergency Pause and Admin Misuse Threat Model](docs/admin-pause-threat-model.md) for malicious or compromised admin scenarios, withdrawal impact, recovery assumptions, mitigations, and residual risks.
See the [Vault Fee Model](docs/vault-fee-model.md) document for clarification on fee assumptions, accounting implications, and user transparency requirements.

## Features

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize(admin, token)` | One-time setup; records the admin and token addresses |
| `deposit(user, amount)` | Add funds to a user's vault |
| `withdraw(user, amount)` | Remove funds from a user's vault |
| `withdraw_lock(user, lock_id)` | Withdraw a specific matured lock entry |
| `get_balance(user)` | Query available (unlocked) balance |
| `lock_funds(user, amount, unlock_time)` | Lock funds until a Unix timestamp |
| `get_locked_balance(user)` | Query locked balance |
| `get_lock(user, lock_id)` | Read one lock record by ID |
| `list_locks(user, offset, limit)` | Page through a user's lock records |
| `can_withdraw(user)` | Check if locked funds are withdrawable |
| `pause(admin, duration_secs)` | Activate emergency pause (blocks deposits/locks; withdrawals remain open) |
| `unpause(admin)` | Deactivate an active pause |
| `is_paused()` | Check whether the contract is currently paused |
| `get_version()` | Query the deployed contract version |

### Deposit and custody

> **Deposits now transfer real tokens into the contract.** Calling `deposit` transfers the specified amount from the user to the contract, and calls `withdraw` transfer the specified amount from the contract to the user. The contract's internal balance tracking ensures withdrawals are limited to unlocked funds.

The contract uses a Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) to manage token transfers, which is specified during contract initialization via the `token` parameter.

---

## Prerequisites

Install the following before you begin:

1. **Rust** (latest stable)
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Soroban CLI**
   ```bash
   cargo install --locked soroban-cli
   ```

3. **WASM target**
   ```bash
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

---

## Build

Compile the contract to a WASM binary:

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Optimized release build (recommended for deployment)
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Optimized release build with an immediate WASM size report
make build-release
```

The compiled `.wasm` file will be at:
```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/savings_vault.wasm
```

### Contract size report

Soroban contract size affects upload and deployment costs and can reveal unexpected binary growth. Use the release wrapper above to build and print the artifact size in both human-readable units and exact bytes:

```text
WASM artifact: target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/savings_vault.wasm
WASM size: 5.73 KiB (5871 bytes)
```

To report the size of an existing release artifact without rebuilding it, run:

```bash
make wasm-size
```

The reporting command exits with an error and identifies the expected path when the WASM file is missing. CI pipelines should run `make build-release` (or `make wasm-size` after their release build) so contract-size changes remain visible in build logs.

---

## Test

Run the full unit test suite:

```bash
cargo test
```

All tests run natively (no WASM needed) using the Soroban SDK test utilities.

---

## Task Runner

Common tasks are available via `make`:

```bash
make test        # Run all tests
make build-wasm  # Build the contract WASM in release mode
make clean       # Clean build artifacts
```
---

## Deploy to Testnet

### 1. Configure the Stellar Testnet

```bash
soroban network add \
  --global testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

### 2. Create & Fund an Identity

```bash
soroban keys generate --global deployer --network testnet
soroban keys address deployer
```

Fund the account at [Stellar Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_ADDRESS).

3. Deploy the Contract

Use the automated deployment script to build the release WASM and deploy it to the network. Pass your configured identity (e.g., `deployer`) as the first argument:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh deployer
```

The script will verify prerequisites, compile the contract, deploy it, and print your new Contract ID. Save the returned Contract ID — you'll need it to invoke functions.

See the [deployment output example](docs/deployment-output-example.md) to learn what successful output looks like and which Contract ID value to copy.

### 4. Initialize the Contract

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id YOUR_CONTRACT_ID \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  initialize \
  --admin deployer
```

### 5. Invoke Functions

```bash
# Deposit 1000 units
soroban contract invoke \
  --id YOUR_CONTRACT_ID \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  deposit \
  --user deployer \
  --amount 1000

# Check balance
soroban contract invoke \
  --id YOUR_CONTRACT_ID \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- \
  get_balance \
  --user deployer
```

## Security Considerations

> **This contract is for educational and testnet use.** Review the following before any mainnet deployment.

### Authorization
- Every state-changing function calls `require_auth()` on the user's address.
- Only the signing user can deposit, withdraw, or lock their own funds.

### Input Validation
- Zero and negative amounts are rejected for deposits, withdrawals, and locks.
- Withdrawals exceeding the available balance are rejected.
- Lock amounts exceeding the available balance are rejected.
- Unlock times in the past are rejected.
- Pause duration of zero is rejected.

### Re-initialization Protection
- `initialize()` can only be called once; subsequent calls panic.

### Emergency Pause
- The admin can activate a time-bounded pause via `pause(admin, duration_secs)`.
- During a pause, `deposit` and `lock_funds` are blocked; `withdraw` and `withdraw_lock` remain available.
- The pause auto-expires after `duration_secs` seconds (auto-unpause).
- Only the admin can pause or unpause (single admin key; multi-sig recommended for mainnet).

### Storage Design
- User balances are stored in **persistent** storage (survives ledger expiry longer).
- Admin and initialization flags use **instance** storage (tied to contract lifetime).

### Known Limitations
- **No admin recovery**: There is no mechanism for the admin to recover or migrate funds.
- **No upgrade mechanism**: The contract does not implement `upgrade()`. See
  [docs/upgrade-strategy.md](docs/upgrade-strategy.md) for research into possible upgrade paths.
- **No on-chain events**: No events are emitted for state changes (deposit, withdraw, lock, unlock). See [docs/events.md](docs/events.md) for planned event schemas.
- **No custom error enum**: Contract uses panic strings instead of a structured error enum for off-chain callers.

- **No custom error enum**: Contract uses panic strings instead of a structured error enum for off-chain callers.

- **No custom error enum**: Contract uses panic strings instead of a structured error enum for off-chain callers.

- **No custom error enum**: Contract uses panic strings instead of a structured error enum for off-chain callers.

- **No custom error enum**: Contract uses panic strings instead of a structured error enum for off-chain callers.
